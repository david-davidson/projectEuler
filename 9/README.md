Pythagorean triples
===================

A Pythagorean triple is a series of three numbers, a &lt; b &lt; c, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This script finds the only Pythagorean triple that sums to 1,000 and prints out its product. For reusability&rsquo;s sake, it accepts input from the command line&mdash;enter `./bin/findPythagoreanTriples 1000` to run the script. (You might need to make the `bin` file executable on your machine.) Alternatively, run `npm install` and then `mocha tests/` to see the tests in action!
